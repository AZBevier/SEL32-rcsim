Following are the instructions for loading an ASCII file to an
MPX-1.X system.  It is assumed that the reader has compiled the
utilities in the taptools directory using the provided makefile.
Filenames on MPX-1.X must be 8 chars or less.

1. Create an ASCII file on Windows or Linux using your favorite editor.
   The EDIT program on MPX works with numbered or unnumbered text files.
   Each record in the text file uses columns 1-72 for text and columns
   73-80 for a line number (xxx.xxx).  This is 80 column card format.

2. To convert a newline terminated file to an MPX file use the utility
   "renum" included in the taptools directory. Lines in the file will
   be expanded to 72 characters or truncated to 72 characters. The
   carriage return characters (\r) will be removed and lines will be
   terminated with a newline (\n).  Line numbers of the form (xxx.xxx)
   will then be appended to the text line to create the card format.
   /somewhere/renum <textfile >cardfile
   
3. The next step is to convert the card image text file to an MPX
   blocked file format.  This involves removing the carriage return
   character and then encoding the line into the blocked format.
   The block file format is the standard file format for MPX.
   /somewhere/mpxblk <cardfile >blkfile

4. Once we have the files converted, the next step involves creating
   a FILEMGR formatted save tape.  The output file will be in SIMH
   .tap simulated tape format.  The tape can then be read by the
   FILEMGR on MPX to load the files into the desired directory.
   The file system on MPX is a flat file where all files are in
   the same file system.  A username is used to separate files for
   each user.  A blank filename implies the system directory.
   /somewhere/mkfmtape -t -u username usertape.tap file1 file2 ...
   Valid options are:
   -p : use file type 0xca for executable programs
   -t : use file type 0xee for text files
   -l : use file type 0xff for library files
   -a : append current files to output tape
   -u username : the username (directory) for the files

    Make sure the usertape.tap file is assigned to the tape drive
    in the .ini file or use the following commands at the sim>
    prompt for SEL32.
    hit ^E to get the sim> prompt.
    sim>detach mta0                remove current assignment
    sim>attach mta0 usertape.tap   assign your restore tape
    sim>go

5. Boot MPX-1.X.  Input @@A to get OPCOM prompt ??.  Use cap lock for
   uppercase input.  Type "EXIT" to OPCOM prompt to get a TSM> prompt.
   If you type WHO, TSM will display your current logon information. 

TSM>WHO
ADDRESS    OWNERNAME   USERNAME
=======    =========   ========
*TY7EFC    CONSOLE              

   The username will be blank for system directory.  Use the command
   TSM>USERNAME JOHNDOE to set username to the one specified in the
   -u option above or just TSM>USERNAME to make it blank.  There is a
   command file on MPX that is handy to restore files from tape that
   does the device assignments to the FILEMGR program.  The file is
   FMGR and can be run to input files from the assigned tape.  MPX-1.X
   has been SYSGEN'd to have 4 tape drives defined at 1000, 1001, 1002,
   & 1003.  SIMH names are mta0, mta1, mta2, & mta3.  So attach the
   restore file to mta0 as show above.  Now execute the FILEMGR program.
   TSM>FMGR 1000
TSM>FMGR 1000
                             * * *   F I L E    M A N A G E R   * * *
 FUNCTION   USER NAME  FILE NAME  DEVICE   START      LENGTH     SPEED
                                         (FIRST BLK) (# BLKS)

   FILEMGR output will be assigned to the terminal and tape input from
   device MT1000. The FILEMGR will output a heading and then the FILEMGR
   prompt FIL>.  At this point you can use the command FIL>SAVELOG to
   list the files on the tape or you can use the command FIL>RESTORE to
   restore the files to the disk.  You can then type EXIT or X to the
   FIL> prompt to exit the FILEMGR.
FIL>RESTORE
 RESTORE  JOHNDOE   FILE1    DM0800      234656       1052       SLOW    
FIL>REWIND IN
       REWIND          (IN)    
FIL>X
TSM>
   If you would like to see your files listed in the system, use
   FMGR again without any parameters.  Then use LOGU to log your
   username files or LOG to log all files.
TSM>FMGR

FIL>LOGU

   all files list here

6. You can use the program EDIT to view or modify the file.  At the
   TSM> prompt type EDIT XX, where XX is a two character editor
   workfile name.  It will show up in the directory listing as XX*WRKFL.
   At the EDT> prompt type USE FILE1.  You will get another prompt when
   the editor is done reading the file.  Hit return to list the file.

TSM>EDIT XX
 BEGIN TEXT EDITOR     
XX*WRKFL CLEAR
EDT> USE FILE1
   File listing will be here.

See the MPX-1.X reference manuals for the other FILEMGR and EDIT commands.
